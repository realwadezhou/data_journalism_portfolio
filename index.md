## Wade Zhou
I am a veteran data journalist with a background in economics and statistics. I use a combination of data analysis and traditional journalism techniques to share insights about the world. I am interested in economics, finance, public policy, politics and technology. Below are a few highlights from my career over the years.

### Longer projects:
##### 1. Returns to higher education
<https://www.economist.com/international/2018/02/03/going-to-university-is-more-important-than-ever-for-young-people>
Possibly my best work. A data-driven look into how the labor market has evolved both in the US and across the world, and how increasingly, higher education was being driven by credentialism, and not skills. More and more, employers are asking for workers for college degrees, even in professions which have not changed much since the 1970s.

###### 2. Value-added university rankings (U.S. and U.K.)
<https://www.economist.com/united-states/2015/10/31/wheres-best>
<https://www.economist.com/britain/2017/08/12/which-british-universities-do-most-to-boost-graduate-salaries>
I co-developed and did much of the coding behind The Economist’s value-added university rankings. We built statistical models to predict how much graduates of different colleges would earn, in order to get a sense of which universities did the most to boost their students’ earnings potential, rather than simply serve as expensive filters. I also did about half of the writing and reporting in each.

###### 3. A statistical analysis of the art on convicts’ bodies
<https://www.economist.com/christmas-specials/2016/12/24/a-statistical-analysis-of-the-art-on-convicts-bodies>
A fun, data-driven piece looking at what a prisoner's tattoos can tell you about them.


### Quicker stories:
##### 1. Technology and inequality in the long run
<https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2017/06/17/what-history-says-about-inequality-and-technology>
This piece tries to look at how income inequality has changed over the very long run. There have been two major events in England drastically reduced income inequality: the Black Death, which raised the bargaining power of workers who survived, and the Industrial Revolution, which reduced the wage premiums commanded by skilled workers. The latter case gives us an important window into how the current AI boom might affect the labor market going forward. What if computer programmers and financial analysts become replaced before plumbers and electricians do?

##### 2. Austria's 100-year bond has delivered stellar performance
<https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2019/09/12/austrias-100-year-bond-has-delivered-stunning-returns>
A short story on how investors poured money into (very) long dated bonds, but took on serious duration risk. This risk later became actualized when central banks around the world hiked interest rates to combat inflation. People who bought what they had thought were safe instruments were subsequently crushed.

##### 3.	Where are the biggest bargains for international travel?
<https://stacker.com/stories/travel/what-are-biggest-bargains-international-travel>
Another light-hearted piece. I built an index to help people find the best countries for Americans to travel to. I used the U.S. News tourism ranking as a baseline, then added data on costs from Google and Priceline. I also factored in how much the local currency has swung against the USD in the past five years, to take into account for places like Japan which had suddenly become more affordable for Americans. I only did the data work on this one.


### Coding projects:
##### 1. Income analysis using GSS data: estimating ability bias
<https://realwadezhou.github.io/orange_banana_fly/>
This is a data analysis project where I tried to understand to what extent a person's wages could be explained by their academic ability, vs what credentials they had. This code is actually a small subcomponent of a bigger project trying to estimate the IRR on higher education, for students of different ability levels. I have formatted the code cleanly and added visualizations and commentary to give people a sense for how I think about working with data.

##### 2. BLS Text generation
<https://github.com/realwadezhou/bls_text_gen>
This is an experiment using LLMs to generate narrative descriptions of the 800+ BLS occupations. I experimented with different LLMs, prompting techniques, cost optimization via batching, and bulit a small system to loop through a long list of job titles to produce text at scale.
